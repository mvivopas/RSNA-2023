# RSNA-2023: Traumatic Injury Diagnosis and Severity Grading

## Introduction and Overview

### Contextual Background

Traumatic injury constitutes a critical and pervasive public health issue on a global scale. These injuries result in over 5 million deaths annually worldwide, rendering accurate and early diagnosis a crucial component for effective medical intervention. Computed Tomography (CT) scans have become an essential tool for evaluating suspected abdominal injuries by providing detailed cross-sectional imagery.

### Problem Statement

The complexity and time-consuming nature of interpreting CT scans for abdominal trauma, especially in cases with multiple injuries or subtle areas of active bleeding, pose a challenge for healthcare professionals. These limitations can compromise the immediacy and effectiveness of medical interventions, thus impacting patient outcomes adversely.

### Objective of This Repository

Aligned with the goals of the Kaggle competition, this repository seeks to utilize Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) for the rapid and accurate detection and severity grading of abdominal injuries based on CT scans. The intention is to develop advanced algorithms that can revolutionize trauma care standards globally.
